Tools for Words with Friends
=======

Tilepile for Words with Friends.   Nothing advanced, just too cheap to buy one.  This isn't really necessary with the newer versions which include this for free

find_words.py uses the enable dictionary to search for possible matches based on an input string 
This probably isn't the most efficient way of doing this.   It's fast enough though.
