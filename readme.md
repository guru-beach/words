Tools for Words with Friends
=======

Tilepile for Words with Friends.   Nothing advanced, just too cheap to buy one.  This isn't really necessary with the newer versions which include this for free

find_words.py uses the enable dictionary to search for possible matches based on an input string 
This probably isn't the most efficient way of doing this.   It's fast enough though.
```
[jake@megatron]python find_words.py toluate 10
absolute
absoluter
absolutes
apetalous
autoclave
autolyse
autolysed
```


You can run find_words on your iPhone, though it's a little trickier than on a computer.  Currently the easiest way is:

1.  Get Python 2.7 from the appstore
2.  Clone this repo somewhere locally
